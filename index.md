The Toronto RepRap User Group is a place to meet your fellow RepRap enthusiasts, share knowledge, learn about the awesome things others are doing, and have a great time!

If you're interested in 3D printing and in or Toronto (or nearby!) you should get on our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/toronto-reprap/) and consider coming to one of our meetups. Our next meetup is on April 30th at [Site 3](http://site3.ca/).
